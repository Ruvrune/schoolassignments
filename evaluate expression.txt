Modify Listing 18.13 EvaluateExpression.py to add operators ^ for exponent and % for modulus. For example, 3 ^ 2 is 9 and 3 % 2 is 1. The ^ operator has the highest precedence and the % operator has the same precedence as the * and / operators.

Note: do not care about unary -, that is expressions like 4 + -2. The code in EvaluateExpression will not handle that.


Here is a sample run of the program:

<sample run>

Enter an expression: (5 * 2 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 % 2) * 4 <Enter icon>

(5 * 2 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 % 2) * 4 = 160

<end sample run>
